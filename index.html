Me and my friends had decided in the class only that we all will sit sit in the same row beside each and will have a talk while hiding our faces with the books. I was just holding the book in front of my face and our teacher came and asked me that, "Srajan are you reading the book ?" Since I was talking with my friends I didn't pay attention that I was holding the book upside-down and replied ,"Yes Mam" and then I realised that what I had done. After that we all were scolded by the teacher.</p>
